This ancient and crumbling shrine is used as a gathering hub and safe haven for many trainers,
merchants and other story related characters. This central bonfire will be visited often, since
it is also a crossroads for many regions and shortcuts. The Crestfallen Warrior speaks about the
Bell of the Awakening which could reside in Undead Parish or Blighttown.
